:robo-middle:Robotic why the hell did you tell me to say this???
:robo-middle:Anyways this was the delayed BETADCIU Robotic was mad about
:robo-middle:I guess it's here now soooo, cool
:robo-middle:Robotic told me to say something else
:robo-middle:Ehem...
:robo-middle:"Huge thanks to WassabiSoja for letting Robotic create a BETADCIU of Pray"
:robo-middle:"You should really check out their stuff"
:bf-left:Who's this soja guy??
:robo-middle:Idk but if Robotic says we should check them out then they have to be "good enough" to be checked out
:robo-middle:I don't know why Robotic told me to specifically use "good enough" in any of my sentences but they probably mean something
:robo-middle:Anyways, ONTO THE BETADCIU!
:robo-middle:also hi taki
